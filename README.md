# Pairwriter

This repository contains the Rust backend that powers the core functionality of the *pairwriter.nvim* Neovim plugin and *pairwriter-vsc* Visual Studio Code extension. The backend provides efficient and reliable text synchronization, leveraging Rust's performance and safety features, and is exposed via Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for integration with these front-end tools.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built in Rust for speed and memory safety.
- **FFI Integration**: Exposes a C-compatible API for interaction with Neovim and Visual Studio Code via plugins/extensions.
- **Text Synchronization**: Provides robust mechanisms for text editing collaboration and synchronization across multiple platforms.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on major operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Neovim

The *pairwriter.nvim* plugin relies on this backend to provide its core functionality. To set it up:

1. Install the *pairwriter.nvim* plugin.
2. Ensure that the shared library generated by this backend is accessible to Neovim.
3. Configure the plugin to use the backend library for communication and synchronization.

For more details, refer to the *pairwriter.nvim* [README](https://github.com/m10090/pairwriter.nvim).

## VSCode

Similarly, *pairwriter-vsc* uses this backend to power its features. After building the backend:

1. Install the *pairwriter-vsc* extension.
2. Configure the extension to load the backend's shared library.
3. The extension will communicate with the backend to handle real-time text synchronization and editing features.

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the *pairwriter-vsc* [README](https://github.com/m10090/pairwriter-vsc).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or propose new features to improve the backend and its integration with Neovim and Visual Studio Code.

### Future

This project is currently in the prototype stage. While it provides a basic level of functionality through FFI integration, future development could include implementing a dedicated Language Server Protocol (LSP) layer of communication. This would enable a more robust and feature-rich text synchronization experience, as well as open the door for additional collaborative features and editor integrations beyond Neovim and Visual Studio Code.

Stay tuned for future updates as the project evolves!
